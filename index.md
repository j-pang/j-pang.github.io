## About Me

I am a research scientist in the Energy Systems Group at [A\*STAR's Institute of High Performance Computing](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/ihpc), where I apply control, learning, and optimization algorithms to study smart grid operations. I also manage the Energy Systems group, and am the Principal Investigator (PI) for the "Modelling the Electrification of Singapore's Harbourcrafts (MESH)" project, which is funded by the Singapore Maritime Institute and the Prime Minister's Office's Science and Technology Policy and Plans Office (S&TPPO). 

I co-lectured an undergraduate Game Theory course as an adjunct in the [Engineering Systems and Design Pillar at SUTD](https://esd.sutd.edu.sg/) last summer with [Prof. Lingjie Duan](https://esd.sutd.edu.sg/people/faculty/lingjie-duan). Before starting at IHPC in 2020, I was a Data Scientist at [Schlumberger's Software Technology and Innovation Center at Menlo Park, CA, USA](https://www.slb.com/), where I was selected to present at SLB's Reservoir Symposium and was later also awarded the Initiator Award at SLB's FIZZ Symposium. 

I received my Ph.D. from [Caltech's Computing and Mathematical Sciences Program](https://www.cms.caltech.edu/) in 2019, where I was supervised by [Prof. Adam Wierman](https://adamwierman.com/) and [Prof. Steven Low](http://netlab.caltech.edu/). At Caltech, I received the [Amori Doctoral Prize in CMS](https://www.cms.caltech.edu/academics/honors) for my dissertation on Online Platforms in Networked Markets. Prior to that, I obtained my Bachelor's Degree in Mathematical Sciences (First Class Honors) from the [Nanyang Technological University's School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/spms) in 2013 under the [Accelerated Bachelor Program](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/cee/current-students/undergraduate/accelerated-bachelor-programme-(abp)). My Ph.D. and B.Sc. studies were funded by [Singapore's National Science Scholarship](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/Scholarships/for-graduate-studies/national-science-scholarship-phd) and the A\*STAR Undergraduate Scholarship.  

My research lies at the intersection of **optimization**, **control**, and **operations research** -- with a special focus on formulating and designing algorithms that are provably "not too bad" in both the offline and online optimization settings. My research is applied in the area of **power and energy systems**, **networking**, **economics**, and **computer science**.

Outside work, I enjoy spending time with my wife Odelia and daughter Eliora, playing badminton, and watching chess. 

## About Energy Systems Group in IHPC, A\*STAR

The Energy Systems Group at IHPC (housed under the Systems Science Department) aims to enable clean, resilient, and autonomous energy systems in Singapore. We develop optimization algorithms and simulation models to study the impact of policy and plans in Singapore, exemplified by the Singapore Integrated Transport and Energy Model (SITEM) project which looks at the impact of vehicle electrification and EV charger placement on Singapore's grid infrastructure. Moving forward, we are also working with partners from and enabling collaboration between academia, government, and industry to study the energy transition in Singapore towards our 2050 targets of a Net-Zero future. 

<strong style="color:#e74d3c; font-weight:600"> We are looking for researchers (both B.Sc./M.Sc. and Ph.D. graduates) who are interested in applying computing and data science in the area of energy systems. Do drop me an email if you are interested. Strong Ph.D. candidates that are interested may also write to me to arrange for a summer or half-year internship. I recommend Ph.D. candidates who are looking for funding opportunities in Singapore to check out the [SINGA Award](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/Scholarships/for-graduate-studies/singapore-international-graduate-award-singa) and [ACIS Scholarship](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/Scholarships/for-graduate-studies/a-star-cis-scholarship). </strong>
