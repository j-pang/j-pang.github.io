## About Me

I am currently a research scientist in the Energy Systems Group at [A\*STAR's Institute of High Performance Computing](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/ihpc), where I apply control, learning, and optimization algorithms to study smart grid operations. I received my Ph.D. from [Caltech's Computing and Mathematical Sciences Program](https://www.cms.caltech.edu/) in 2019, where I was supervised by [Prof. Adam Wierman](https://adamwierman.com/) and [Prof. Steven Low](http://netlab.caltech.edu/). I received the [Amori Doctoral Prize in CMS](https://www.cms.caltech.edu/academics/honors) for my dissertation on Online Platforms in Networked Markets. I obtained my Bachelor's Degree in Mathematical Sciences (Pure Mathematics Track) from the [Nanyang Technological University's School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/spms). 

My research lies at the intersection of **optimization**, **learning**, and **control** -- with a special focus on formulating and designing "not too bad" algorithms that work in both the offline and online optimization settings. My research is applied in the area of **power and energy systems**, **networking**, **economics**, and **computer science**.

<strong style="color:#e74d3c; font-weight:600"> At IHPC, we are looking for researchers (both B.Sc./M.Sc. and Ph.D. graduates) who are interested in applying computing and data science in the area of energy systems. Do drop me an email if you are interested. </strong>
